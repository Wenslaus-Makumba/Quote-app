# Quotes App
 An application where users can create quotes and have those quotes voted on whether they are terrible or are inspirational. 

# Project Description

This is a web app for  Quotes Manager. It's comprised of a  display dection that shows all the quotes saved on the system, alongside a form to add more quotes to the system. The layout is friendly to use and basic/self-explanatory to a new user.

# Behaviour Driven Development
The applicaton has various conmpents that work together to achieve a view,some of the components are:
    The form- the user is able to add,delete and modify the quote
    Handling quotes
    Displaying extra details for each quote- shows details of the quotes added
    The header- this is the header of the app
    The footer-this is the footer of the app
    
They are all nested in the final index.html that is the major renderer for all components we have and also some components are nested in each other like the one for handling quotes that has the one for extra details nested in it.
